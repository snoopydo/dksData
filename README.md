dksData
=======

Simple ORM born from finally having typed enougth IDataReader to object mapping code.

This was started a month or so prior to dapper bursting onto the scene and making me more aware of a few existing projects.
I've continued because its not only a learning exercise, but it does what I need done, done the way I want it.

If you'r after a supported, singing and dancing ORM this isn't it, it does a few things (well I belive) and nothing more.

Oh, "It works on my machine"

Dapper or PetaPoco are two that might be worth a look at.
